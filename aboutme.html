		Hi, everybody!<br><br>After achieving my bachelors degree in History and Philosophy, I started my career as a Teach for America teacher in Hawaii  and moved to obtain my Masters degree in Library and Information Science as a means to develop my understanding of how my students and others interact with new technologies. I use this background in my current position developing and designing online corporate compliance courses. For the past three years, I’ve developed courses for a variety of different audiences, from a code of conduct training for a mostly millenial in-store audience for a large cell phone service provider, to an anti-discrimination training for a large national chain of coffee shops.<br><br>One major question I’ve focused on in my work has been: how do you interest users in required corporate compliance? The answer has often lain in affirming the relevance of the material to their day-to-day. This is directly related to my time as a teacher, committed to culturally responsive teaching.<br><br>My main focus has always been that, if you make it relevant, they'll be interested!
